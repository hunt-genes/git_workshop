# Instructions for Git workshop with [Kelly Sovacool](https://github.com/kelly-sovacool)

Anyone who would like to follow along during the interactive workshop should make sure they have the following setup in advance:

- a Unix shell running bash or zsh (e.g. terminal on macOS & Linux, or WSL on Windows). 
  [bash shell](https://umcarpentries.org/intro-curriculum-r/setup.html#the-bash-shell)
- git (run `git --version` to see if you already have it installed). 
  [git setup instructions](https://umcarpentries.org/intro-curriculum-r/setup.html#git-1)
- a text editor (e.g. nano, vim, Atom, Sublime, RStudio). You probably already have one that you're familiar with, feel free to use whatever you like. 
- a GitHub account. If you already have one, make sure you know the email associated with your account & password.
  [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- the Git Credential Manager. Follow these instructions.
  [Caching credentials](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git)
- Download the [zip archive](https://github.com/bnwolford/KGJebsen/blob/main/un-report-project.zip) and unzip it to somewhere that's easy to remember, like your desktop.

Assumes a little bit of experience with unix shell and command line interface.
