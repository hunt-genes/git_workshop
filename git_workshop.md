# Instructions for Git workshop with Kelly Sovacool

Anyone who would like to follow along during the interactive workshop should make sure they have the following setup in advance:

- a Unix shell running bash or zsh (e.g. terminal on macOS & Linux, or WSL on Windows). https://umcarpentries.org/intro-curriculum-r/setup.html#the-bash-shell
- git (run `git --version` to see if you already have it installed). https://umcarpentries.org/intro-curriculum-r/setup.html#git-1
- a text editor (e.g. nano, vim, Atom, Sublime, RStudio). You probably already have one that you're familiar with, feel free to use whatever you like. 
- a GitHub account. If you already have one, make sure you know the email associated with your account & password. https://github.com/
- the Git Credential Manager. Follow these instructions https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git
- Download the [zip archive](../un-report-project.zip) and unzip it to somewhere that's easy to remember, like your desktop.

Assumes a little bit of experience with unix shell and command line interface.
